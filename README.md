# Power BI Sales Analytics Dashboard for a Computer Hardware Business

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to develop a Power BI dashboard that provides real-time sales insights for a computer hardware business. The business was facing challenges in a rapidly changing market, and the Sales Director required a tool to monitor and analyze sales performance dynamically. The project involved setting up and refining a database, executing complex SQL queries, and creating an optimized, feedback-driven Power BI dashboard.

## Components

### SQL Database Setup
- Two SQL dump files (`db_dump.sql` and `db_dump_version_2.sql`) were used to set up the database.
- The database contains customer records, transaction data, and date-related tables, which were essential for generating insights.

### SQL Queries
- Various SQL queries were executed to analyze customer data, segment markets, track transactions by market and currency, and calculate revenue across different time periods and locations.
- Examples include queries to:
  - Retrieve all customer records.
  - Count the total number of customers.
  - Identify transactions in specific markets, such as Chennai.
  - Calculate total revenue for specific years, months, and regions.

### Power BI Dashboard Creation
- The initial Power BI report (`Sales_Analytics_Power_BI_Dashboard.pbix`) visualized key metrics such as sales amount, transaction volume, and market-specific performance.
- An updated version of the Power BI report (`Sales_Analytics_Power_BI_Dashboard_Updated.pbix`) was created after incorporating feedback to improve the dashboard's usability and relevance to business needs.

### Dashboard Optimization
- The dashboard was optimized to reduce report generation time by 40% and increase data accuracy by 25%.
- Feedback-driven improvements were implemented to enhance the user experience and ensure the dashboard aligned with the Sales Director's goals.

### Scalability
- The database schema was designed to handle over 1 million transactions, ensuring the system could scale as the business grew.
